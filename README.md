The Movie Layout is a simple web-based implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It presents movie posters, titles, and ratings in a clean and structured flexbox layout for an organized and responsive display. This project is great for learning and experimenting with front-end design concepts.

Feel free to explore and customize it to your needs! 🎬🍿
